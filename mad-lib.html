        <p>A short story is a brief work of <span id="Adjective">(Adjective)</span>, 
        usually written in <span id="write anything">(write anything)</span>. 
        Emerging from earlier oral storytelling 
        traditions in the 17th century, the short story has grown to encompass a 
        body of work so diverse as to defy easy <span id="noun">(noun)</span>. 
        At its most prototypical the short story features a small 
        cast of named characters, and focuses on a self-contained 
        incident with the intent of evoking a "single effect" 
        or <span id="feeling">(feeling)</span>. 
        In doing so, short stories make use of plot, <span id="name">(name)</span>, 
        and other dynamic components to a far greater degree than is 
        typical of an anecdote, yet to a far lesser degree than a novel. 
        While the short story is largely distinct from the novel, 
        authors of both generally draw from a common pool of literary 
        <span id="place">(place)</span>.</p>
